# m_overview

This repository consists of links to and descriptions of the various elements of a project that involved creating various iterations of a music rating app, named _M_. These involved writing code for a website advertising the app, coding it as a web app utilizing PHP for the back end and React for the front end, and coding it as an IOS and Android compatible app using React Native. All of these aspects of the project were worked on and coded together by Aleks Jacewicz and Kelleigh Entrekin.

This repostory contains code for a web-page advertising the _M_ app, with sections of it including "About", "Features", "Timeline", "Premium" and "Further Information". This web-page is made of up several HTML code fragments, along with some CSS styling. The site itself can be seen [here](https://a-jacewicz.github.io/music_app_landing_page/)
