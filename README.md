# m_overview

This repository consists of links to and descriptions of the various elements of a project that involved creating various iterations of a music rating app, named _M_. These involved writing code for a website advertising the app, coding it as a web app utilizing PHP for the backend and React for the frontend, and coding it as an IOS and Android Compatable app using React Native. All of these aspects of the project were worked on and coded together by Aleks Jacewicz and Kelleigh Entrekin.
